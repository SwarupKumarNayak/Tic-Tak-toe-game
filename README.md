How to Play:
Open the Main.html file in any modern web browser.
The game board will appear as a 3x3 grid. Player X will always start.
Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their mark (X or O).
The game will automatically detect a winner, or if all cells are filled, it will declare a draw.
If the game ends, click the "Restart Game" button to play again.
